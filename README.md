# Bank Loan Data Analysis for Business Insights

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze the bank's loan data to gain valuable insights into various key performance indicators (KPIs), loan statuses, and trends that will aid in decision-making processes. Using data from the `bank_loan_data_db` database, the project aims to identify patterns, assess the financial performance of loan issuance and repayment, and evaluate the overall health of the loan portfolio.

## Key Metrics and Analyses

### 1. **Loan Applications**
- **Objective**: Analyze the total number of loan applications, as well as the monthly breakdown for the current month (MTD) and the previous month (PMTD).

### 2. **Funded Amounts**
- **Objective**: Evaluate total loan amounts funded, along with MTD and PMTD figures, to assess overall lending activity and trends in the bankâ€™s funding behavior.

### 3. **Payments Received**
- **Objective**: Examine the total payments received, comparing MTD and PMTD values to understand cash flow and loan repayment trends.

### 4. **Interest Rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI)**
- **Objective**: Calculate averages for interest rates and DTI ratios, both overall and for MTD and PMTD, to measure the bank's risk exposure and lending practices.

### 5. **Good vs. Bad Loans**
- **Objective**:
  - Identify the percentage of good loans (fully paid or current) and bad loans (charged off).
  - Analyze the amounts funded and received for both categories to refine loan approval strategies and risk management.

### 6. **Loan Status Breakdown**
- **Objective**: Provide a comprehensive breakdown of loan statuses, including:
  - Number of applications.
  - Total amounts funded.
  - Total payments received for each status (e.g., current, fully paid, charged off).

### 7. **Loan Report Overview**
- **Objective**: Examine additional factors such as:
  - Monthly trends.
  - State-wise performance.
  - Loan term distribution.
  - Employment length distribution.
  - Purpose of loan.
  - Home ownership status.
