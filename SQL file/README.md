# Bank Loan Data Analysis Project

## Need to imcoperated a dashbaord soon for now you will see all the code I have used for this project.


## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of bank loans to derive meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs). Using SQL queries, we evaluated borrower behavior, loan status, funding amounts, and various other metrics to support data-driven decision-making. Screenshots of query results have been included to document the outputs.

## Queries and Results


---

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into bank loan data, including average interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and the distribution of loans across various categories. The queries and results can be expanded further by integrating advanced analytics and visualization tools such as Power BI.

## Key Findings from the Analysis
# Loan Applications:

Overall: Total number of loan applications processed.
Monthly Trends: Highlight any significant increases or decreases in loan applications for the current month compared to the previous month.
Insight: Seasonal or promotional campaigns might influence application trends.
Loan Funding:

Total Funded Amounts: The total value of loans funded by the bank.
Trend Analysis: Compare monthly figures to evaluate the growth or decline in lending activities.
Insight: Funding trends reflect the bank's lending strategy and economic conditions.
Payments and Repayments:

Total Payments Received: Quantify cash inflow from loan repayments.
Comparison: Highlight trends for the current and previous months.
Insight: Steady or growing payments suggest a healthy repayment rate; declines may signal risks.
Interest Rates and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios:

Risk Indicators: Present averages for interest rates and DTI ratios.
Implications: A higher DTI may correlate with a higher risk of loan default.
Good vs. Bad Loans:

Performance Metrics: Breakdown of loans categorized as “good” (fully paid or current) vs. “bad” (charged off).
Funded vs. Received: Compare the funded amounts to repayments across categories.
Insight: Adjustments to risk models may be needed if bad loans are significant.
Loan Status Breakdown:

Distribution by Status: Detail how many loans are fully paid, current, or charged off.
Performance Overview: Payments received and outstanding amounts per status.
Demographic and Behavioral Insights:

Loan Purpose: Identify which loan purposes are most common and their repayment performance.
Homeownership and Employment: Evaluate whether these factors influence loan approval or repayment trends.
Geographical Analysis: State-wise performance might highlight areas with higher risks or opportunities.
Recommendations for Stakeholders
Risk Management:

Use insights from bad loan percentages and DTI ratios to refine borrower screening processes.
Consider introducing incentives for borrowers with good repayment histories to reduce delinquency rates.
Loan Product Optimization:

Focus on high-performing categories (e.g., loan purposes with better repayment records).
Tailor interest rates to borrower profiles to balance risk and profitability.
Geographical Targeting:

Expand or optimize operations in regions with high demand and good repayment performance.
Investigate reasons behind poor performance in underperforming areas and address root causes.
Strategy and Planning:

Seasonal or campaign-based promotions could align with trends in loan application volumes.
Adjust funding strategies based on monthly trends to maintain a stable portfolio.

### Future Work
- Incorporate visual dashboards using Power BI.
- Analyze additional metrics such as repayment trends and delinquency rates.
- Expand the dataset for multi-year trends.
