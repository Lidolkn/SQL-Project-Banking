## Need to imcoperated a dashbaord soon for now you will see all the code I have used for this project.


## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of bank loans to derive meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs). Using SQL queries, we evaluated borrower behavior, loan status, funding amounts, and various other metrics to support data-driven decision-making. Screenshots of query results have been included to document the outputs.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into bank loan data, including average interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and the distribution of loans across various categories. The queries and results can be expanded further by integrating advanced analytics and visualization tools such as Power BI.

### Future Work
- Incorporate visual dashboards using Power BI.
- Analyze additional metrics such as repayment trends and delinquency rates.
- Expand the dataset for multi-year trends.
